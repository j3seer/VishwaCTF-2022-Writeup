# Challenge description

Why do i feel that this is incomplete?

-----------------------------------------------------------

In this challenge we were provided an image that had what appears to be a rot ciphered text

Decoding it gives us :

``` SECRET MEETING AT THE PALACE ```

We then use that as a key with the OurSecret tool 


We get a .wav file and by reading the spectrum we find the flag 



``` Flag : vishwaCTF{sp3c70gram_crack3d} ```

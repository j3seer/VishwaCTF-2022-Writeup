# Challenge description

Somebody hosted this website having flag in it. Just request the FLAG to them maybe they will give you. https://r3qu35t-m3-fl4g.vishwactf.com/

This challenge took us a while.. but the solution was pretty simple.

Just intercept the request with burp and change the method to FLAG:
